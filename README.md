# Legacy Mechanics Mod

## Setup

Head over to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jtJava/LegacyMechanics/actions) to download the latest version of this mod.
This mod changes clientside mechanics enough so that you won't instantly be banned when playing on a 1.8 server. There are some scenarios where you will still flag anticheats that I have not gotten around to yet. Water/Lava/Beds/Slimes/Ladder will all have incorrect mechanics. Basic PvP should be fine.
